# Commitment
For this assignment we were tasked with creating a web page with at least 100 git commit's. However the end product of the assignment was left open ended. In class our instructor David Schaal told us we were allowed to subvert his expectations and really do anything. So as a cheeky response to that wording I, as a coder, took the most efficient route possible to do this assignment. By using the bash commands we can do:
" for i in {1..100}; do git commit --allow-empty -m $(head -c 500 /dev/urandom | base64 | head -c 20); done " 
This command allowed me to create 100 empty commits with random base64 commit messages that are 20 characters long. I then took these random commit messages and placed them on the web page, and stylized them to look blocky and "techy". While I understand that this was not the intention of the assignment, I felt comfortable doing it due to already having a couple years of git experience under my belt. I think the piece is interesting as a commentary on automation and it's effects on creativity. Though I'll admit I was looking for an easy way out of manually doing 100 commits when I've already done 128 commits in the past.
